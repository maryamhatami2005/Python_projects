This project contains a password generator application written in Python. The generator can create three types of passwords:

1. Random Passwords
2. Memorable Passwords
3. Pin Codes
## Project Structure

## Requirements
 - Python 3.7+
 - NLTK
  
to install NLTK, use pip:
```
pip install nltk
```

After installing NLTK, you need to download the 'words' corpus. Run Python and type these commands:
